# Skill Catalog

All 63 skills this package ships, grouped by what you reach for them for. Each description is the
skill's own `description:` front-matter, trimmed to one line — nothing here claims a capability the
skill does not declare.

A skill is invoked by name: `/skill-name` in Claude Code, `$skill-name` in Codex. Follow any row's
link to read the skill itself.

Writing the README itself is not in this catalog.
[`pekral/github-readme-generator`](https://github.com/pekral/github-readme-generator) is a
standalone Agent Skill that builds a repository's root `README.md` from its code, manifests,
scripts, tests, and workflows. Install it with `npx skills add pekral/github-readme-generator`, or
as a Claude Code plugin from its own marketplace.
