// the seed script, so the table is pinned here value by value.
//
// Per the project's test-isolation rule a Pest test cannot exec a real .sh,
// so the behavioural proof lives in the script's own `--self-test`, which
// `composer build` runs via `@shell-self-tests` (the precedent is
// `skills/_shared/assert-current-repo.sh`): it runs the script end-to-end
// against a stubbed `gh` and asserts the add / remove / keep decisions and the
// exact `gh issue edit` argv. These guards pin the scenarios that self-test is
// required to keep covering, so the behavioural suite cannot be gutted without
// a failing test here.
