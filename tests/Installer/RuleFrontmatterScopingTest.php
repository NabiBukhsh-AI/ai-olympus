    // `rules/code-review/general.md` carries one more re-baseline: the blanket *Strict rule
    // compliance* walk is retired, so the two sentences that cited it as a live walk were repointed
    // and the severity stratification it defined moved into this file as *Default severity for a
    // rule violation* — surviving bullets still need a default when their own rule file declares
    // none. Nothing else in the file moved.
    // `rules/code-review/general.md` carries one more re-baseline: both refactoring sections of the

    // `rules/code-review/general.md` carries one last re-baseline: the Minor bucket is retired, so

    // published at whatever severity its own scale assigns.

    // sentences that spelled the convergence gate out as a count now cite the one place that
    // computes it, so the package holds exactly one definition of convergence.
    // `rules/reports/general.md` carries one re-baseline of its own: the bullet naming what falls

    // GitHub fields, JIRA's reduced "only How to test" shape), and `pr-summary` now renders one
    // shape on every target. The bullet describes that shape instead, and states the consequence
    // this rule owns — headings and field labels are prose, so they are translated with the rest of
