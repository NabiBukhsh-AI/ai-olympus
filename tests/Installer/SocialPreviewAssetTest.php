 * Issue #193 — the social-preview asset still advertised `argos`, an agent removed in #179, and
 * never gained `april`. Every other surface that names the roster (`README.md`, `docs/agents.md`,
 * the rules, the issue template) was swept in lockstep; this one asset was missed because nothing
 * derived its content from `agents/*.md`.
 *
 * These tests close that gap: the portrait labels are checked against the live roster, and the rendered
 * PNG is bound to the SVG it came from so a future edit cannot ship the vector without the raster.
