// it does across those responses — following a `Link: rel="next"` header, stopping
// at the first project page that carries the slug, keeping a pruned event from
// aborting the document — is what actually breaks. Per the project's test-isolation
// rule a Pest test cannot exec a real .sh against the network, so the behavioural
// proof lives in the script's own `--self-test` (the precedent is
// `skills/github-issue-triage/scripts/assign-priorities.sh --self-test`) and these
// guards pin the scenarios that self-test is required to cover. Pinning source
// patterns instead would prove only that a line exists, never that a second page
