        h2. Acceptance criteria

        3 of 4 criteria are met and an automated test verifies each of them.

        * Bulk sending to over 500 recipients is not verified. It needs a run on a real account. Who can run one such send?

        h2. Review findings

        * The merge is blocked by a missing check that a second save keeps another person's action. Without it the data loss can return.
        * A deleted action stays in the pipeline overview until the page is reloaded, so a user can believe the delete failed and try again.

        h2. What changed

        * Adding an action no longer empties the pipeline when two people edit one campaign at once. Before, the second save discarded the first action.
        * A bulk send now reports the number of recipients it actually reached, instead of always reporting the number requested.
        * Reordering actions saves on the first attempt. Before, the order silently reverted for pipelines with more than ten actions.

        h2. Impact after deployment

        * Campaign pipelines: every save of a pipeline goes through the changed code. A user may notice a slower save on a pipeline with many actions.
        * Bulk sending: the delivery report shows the reached count, so it can be lower than before for the same send.
